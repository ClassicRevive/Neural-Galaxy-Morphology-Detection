This project proposes several contributions to the
existing literature on galaxy morphology identification (Multi-label classification task with probability constraints).
We introduce constraints into our loss function
that help our models better emulate human responses
when classifying galaxy morphologies by
image. We also introduce a modified transformer-based
architecture (Vision Transformer) that perform
competitively versus convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) in such tasks.
