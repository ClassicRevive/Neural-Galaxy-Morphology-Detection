This report proposes several contributions to the
existing literature on galaxy image classification.
We introduce constraints into our loss function
that help our models better emulate human responses
when classifying galaxy morphologies by
image. We also introduce a modified Transformerbased
architecture (Vision Transformer) that perform
competitively versus convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) in such tasks.
